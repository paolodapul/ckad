### **Course Outline: Mastering Multi-Container Pod Design Patterns in Kubernetes (EKS Focused)**

#### **Module 1: Introduction to Multi-Container Pod Design in EKS**
- Overview of Kubernetes in AWS EKS
- Understanding Kubernetes Pods in managed clusters
- When and why to use multi-container Pods in EKS
- AWS EKS-specific considerations (IAM roles, networking)

#### **Module 2: The Sidecar Pattern in EKS**
- What is a Sidecar container?
- Practical use cases in AWS (logging, security, monitoring)
- Implementing a Sidecar for centralized logging with Fluent Bit on EKS
- Using a Sidecar for service mesh (Istio on EKS)
- **Hands-on Lab:** Deploy a Sidecar container for logging in EKS

#### **Module 3: The Init Container Pattern in EKS**
- What are Init Containers?
- Common use cases: database migrations, dependency checks
- Configuring Init Containers in a managed EKS environment
- **Hands-on Lab:** Deploy an Init Container for database setup in Amazon RDS

#### **Module 4: The Adapter Pattern in EKS**
- What is the Adapter pattern?
- Use cases: Data transformation, backward compatibility
- Implementing an adapter container for API request/response modifications
- **Hands-on Lab:** Deploy an adapter container for an AWS Lambda-based API Gateway integration

#### **Module 5: The Ambassador Pattern in EKS**
- What is an Ambassador container?
- Use cases: Proxying requests, enabling API versioning
- Using Envoy as an Ambassador container in EKS
- **Hands-on Lab:** Deploy an Nginx Ambassador to route requests between multiple microservices

#### **Module 6: Advanced Multi-Container Deployments in EKS**
- Managing inter-container communication via shared storage (AWS EBS, EFS)
- Configuring Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) in multi-container Pods
- Best practices for EKS workloads with multi-container setups
- **Hands-on Lab:** Deploy a multi-container Pod using AWS EFS for shared storage

#### **Module 7: Observability and Debugging in EKS**
- Monitoring multi-container Pods with AWS CloudWatch and Prometheus
- Debugging containers in AWS EKS (`kubectl logs`, `kubectl exec`)
- Using AWS-native observability tools: AWS X-Ray for tracing
- **Hands-on Lab:** Implement centralized logging and monitoring for multi-container Pods in EKS

#### **Module 8: Security Best Practices in Multi-Container Pods**
- Using AWS IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA) in EKS
- Implementing SecurityContexts and network policies for multi-container Pods
- Securing inter-container communication in AWS-managed environments
- **Hands-on Lab:** Secure multi-container Pods using IAM and network policies

#### **Module 9: Real-World Use Cases in AWS EKS**
- Deploying CI/CD pipelines with multi-container Pods in EKS (GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline)
- Service mesh integration with Sidecar containers in EKS (Istio, App Mesh)
- Implementing a logging stack (Fluent Bit, CloudWatch, Grafana) for multi-container apps
- **Hands-on Lab:** Deploy a real-world microservices-based application using multi-container Pods

#### **Module 10: Capstone Project**
- Design and deploy a real-world multi-container application in AWS EKS
- Implement logging, monitoring, and security best practices
- Performance optimization and cost efficiency considerations
- **Final Hands-on Project:** Deploy a scalable and secure multi-container application in AWS EKS
