## Course Outline: Mastering Kustomize for Kubernetes

### **Module 1: Introduction to Kustomize**
- Overview of Kubernetes configuration management
- What is Kustomize, and why use it?
- Differences between Helm and Kustomize
- Installing and setting up Kustomize

### **Module 2: Fundamentals of Kustomize**
- Understanding base and overlays
- Structure of a Kustomization directory
- Working with `kustomization.yaml`
- Applying configurations using `kubectl kustomize`

### **Module 3: Customizing Kubernetes Manifests**
- Patching resources (strategic merge vs. JSON patches)
- Using `namePrefix` and `nameSuffix`
- Setting `commonLabels` and `commonAnnotations`
- Configuring `configMapGenerator` and `secretGenerator`

### **Module 4: Advanced Kustomization Techniques**
- Overriding images with `images` field
- Setting environment variables dynamically
- Patching Deployments, Services, and Ingresses
- Handling multiple overlays (dev, staging, production)
- Using external patches for customization

### **Module 5: Working with Helm and Kustomize Together**
- Combining Kustomize with Helm charts
- Using `helm template` with Kustomize overlays
- Managing Helm-generated manifests with Kustomize

### **Module 6: Managing Large-Scale Deployments**
- Organizing a scalable Kustomize project
- Using Kustomize in GitOps workflows (e.g., ArgoCD, Flux)
- Version control strategies for Kustomize manifests
- Best practices for large teams

### **Module 7: CI/CD Integration with Kustomize**
- Using Kustomize with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Jenkins
- Automating deployment updates
- Integrating Kustomize with Terraform and Pulumi

### **Module 8: Debugging and Troubleshooting**
- Debugging common Kustomize issues
- Validating Kustomize output
- Using `kubectl kustomize` and `kubectl apply` effectively

### **Final Project: Real-World Kubernetes Deployment with Kustomize**
- Set up a complete CI/CD pipeline with Kustomize
